## Pre-Meeting Context

### Document 1: Email to Glenn - Website Project Thoughts

```
Hi Glenn,

I've been thinking about our website project, and I wanted to share some thoughts about how we should approach this with the design firm. The more I consider it, the more I realize we're not just updating a church website - we're creating something unique that reflects who Ebenezer is becoming.

Our Unique Position
With the Pardue Center now open, we're really operating as two interconnected entities: a traditional Methodist church with 170+ years of history, AND a modern community event center. This isn't a challenge to overcome - it's actually our biggest strength. We should lean into this dual identity rather than trying to make everything feel uniform.

Think about our different audiences:
• Traditional congregation members who want service times, sermons, and ministry info
• People searching for contemporary worship options
• Community members looking for concert tickets or event venues
• Nonprofits needing meeting space
• Couples searching for wedding venues

Each group has different needs, and our website needs to serve them all without confusion.

Working with What We Have
I know we just implemented One Church Software for member management, online giving, and sermons. It's an affordable solution that should handle our basic church operations just fine. But from what I can tell, it doesn't have the professional-level ticketing capabilities we'll need for Pardue Center events - most church management systems at that price point don't. That's okay - lots of churches run hybrid systems, especially once they start operating venues. We just need to be smart about how we integrate everything.

Ticketing Solutions That Could Work Alongside One Church
Since we need robust ticketing that can handle assigned seating, different price tiers, and professional-looking ticket pages, we should ask the design firm about integrating one of these dedicated ticketing platforms:

Eventbrite (https://www.eventbrite.com/)
• The industry standard that everyone knows and trusts
• Can be embedded right into our website
• Handles everything from free community events to paid concerts
• Takes about 3.7% + $1.79 per ticket for paid events
• Professional looking, mobile-friendly

TicketLeap (https://www.ticketleap.com/)
• Specifically good for performing arts and venue-based events
• Slightly cheaper than Eventbrite
• Can create a branded box office page
• Good customer support

Brown Paper Tickets (https://www.brownpapertickets.com/)
• Known for being nonprofit-friendly
• Lower fees than most competitors
• Not as polished looking but very functional

The key is making sure whatever we choose can be seamlessly embedded into our website so people don't feel like they're being bounced around to different platforms.

Questions for the Design Firm
Here's what I think we should ask them when we meet:
1. How do we create a cohesive experience when we're using One Church Software for church functions and a separate platform for event ticketing?
2. Can you make the ticketing integration feel native to our site rather than obviously embedded from elsewhere?
3. Have you worked with churches that also operate event venues? Can you show us examples?
4. How would you structure the navigation so someone looking for concert tickets doesn't get lost in church information, and vice versa?
5. What's your approach to SEO? We need to rank for "Methodist church Milton GA" AND "event venue Milton Roswell" AND "concert venue North Metro Atlanta."
6. How do we handle the fact that donations go through One Church but ticket sales would go through a different processor?
7. What kind of calendar system do you recommend that can pull from both One Church (for church events) and our ticketing platform (for Pardue events)?

The Bottom Line
I think we should be really clear with the design firm that we're not trying to hide our church identity when promoting events, nor are we trying to make the Pardue Center feel "churchy" when someone's booking it for a wedding. We're both things, and that's okay.

We also need to be upfront that we're working with existing systems - One Church Software is our entry-level solution for now, and we need a design that can elegantly incorporate multiple platforms without making it feel disjointed to the end user. As we grow, we might revisit our platform choices, but for now we need to make these pieces work together.

The website should feel warm and welcoming like we are, but also professional enough that someone would trust buying concert tickets through it.

We might even want to consider having a main landing page that asks "What brings you to Ebenezer?" with two clear paths - one for worship/church life and one for events/venue. Just a thought.

What do you think? Should we schedule some time to talk through this before the next meeting with the design firm? I think if we go in with a clear vision of this dual identity and some specific technical constraints, we'll get a much better result.

Let me know your thoughts when you get a chance.

Thanks,
~C.H.

### Document 2: Research on Modern Church Websites

```
Hey Glenn,
I've been digging into some research on modern church websites as we think about our redesign, and I wanted to share what I found. I looked at what the top churches are doing these days and identified a couple of standout examples that really capture where church web design is heading.

Two Sites Worth Looking At

The Austin Stone Community Church - austinstone.org
This one keeps coming up in every "best church websites" article I've read. What makes it special is that it doesn't look like every other church site out there. They've gone with a really clean, artistic approach that uses lots of white space and beautiful photography to tell their story. It feels contemporary without trying too hard.
Their sermon library is particularly well done – you can actually find what you're looking for quickly, which is more than I can say for most church sites.

Elevation Church - elevationchurch.org
This has been the gold standard that everyone copies for the past several years. They just did a major redesign this year and it's still setting the bar. What I appreciate about their approach is how they've simplified their navigation – instead of cramming everything into the menu, they focus on the most important actions people want to take.
They also do a great job keeping people on their site instead of just sending them to YouTube for sermons.

What I'm Seeing Across the Board
The patterns are pretty consistent:
* Mobile-first thinking – Over half of visitors are on phones, so everything has to work perfectly there
* Less is more – Clean layouts with lots of breathing room instead of cramming everything above the fold
* Real people, real moments – Authentic photos of actual congregation members rather than stock photography
* Clear next steps – Simple buttons like "Plan Your Visit" or "Watch Online" that make it obvious what newcomers should do
* Video integration – Not just sermon archives, but using video to show the life of the church
* Fast and functional – Sites that load quickly and don't make people hunt for basic information

What struck me most is how these sites manage to feel both modern and welcoming. They're not trying to be flashy – they're trying to be helpful and authentic. The Austin Stone has more of an artistic, unique vibe while Elevation goes for clean and professional, but both nail the fundamentals.

I think there's a lot we can learn from how they organize content and present information. Worth taking a look when you have a few minutes.

A Local Example
Woodstock City Church - woodstockcity.org
This is a great example of a regional church that's really nailed the modern approach. Their site has that same clean, contemporary feel as the national examples but maintains a warm, community-focused vibe. What I particularly like is how they showcase their actual events and programs with professional photography – you can really get a sense of what their community is like.

They've also done a nice job organizing all their different age group programs and making it easy for families to understand what's available. The navigation is intuitive and everything loads quickly.

It's encouraging to see that the kind of quality we're talking about is definitely achievable right here in our region.

Let me know what you think, and if you want to chat more about any of this stuff!
Thanks, ~Charles

## Meeting Setup

**User Request:** Real-time notes and ideas during church brainstorming session

**Core Challenge:** Ebenezer isn't just a church website redesign — it's a dual-identity situation. 170-year-old Methodist congregation AND the Pardue Center event venue. Site needs to serve both without confusion.

**Technical Constraints:**
- One Church Software already in place (giving, sermons, member management)
- Likely need separate ticketing platform (Eventbrite, TicketLeap, or Brown Paper Tickets) for Pardue events
- Design firm needs to make these feel integrated

**Design Direction:**
- Clean, mobile-first, authentic photography (not stock)
- Clear pathways for different audiences
- Floated idea: Landing page split "What brings you to Ebenezer?" → Church Life or Events/Venue

**Inspiration Sites:**
- Austin Stone (artistic, white space, great sermon library)
- Elevation (clean, simplified nav, keeps people on-site)
- Woodstock City (local proof it's achievable)

1. **Generate ideas** - Whiteboard everything
2. **Prioritize** - What can we actually do?
3. **Do fewer things well** - "Hit a home run" on what we choose
4. **Phase the work** - Leave stuff for Year 2, Year 3

---

## Meeting Notes (Real-Time Capture)

### Vision Discussion

**Bob's Opening Question:** What's our vision?

**Glenn's Response:**
- Conversational, welcoming atmosphere — "love on them" (but they have to get here first)
- Multi-generational / Inter-generational — not siloed by age
- Multi-racial — diverse community

**Bob's Observation:** "Big canvas" — aspirational and broad

### Two Channels (Ryan)

**Digital:**
- Website
- Social media
- SEO
- Online presence

**Physical:**
- Signage (they're on a busy corner!)
- High traffic = free eyeballs
- Curb appeal, visibility

**Constraint:** Glenn notes City of Milton restricts options for physical signs

**Ryan's Ideas:**
- Human sign spinner (workaround to signage restrictions)
- Events AS advertising — bring people in for Santa, concerts, community events. The event IS the marketing.

### Website Focus (Bob & Ryan)

**Bob's Focus Areas:**
- Data/content that draws people in
- Give them a reason to visit
- Video — show the life of the church
- Clear messaging
- Practical info: nursery, kids programs, service times, etc.

**Ryan's Reality Check:**
- Website enhancement is a multi-month effort
- Needs photography, video, content, design, technical work
- Looked at competing church sites in the area — very focused on moving pictures, lively, dynamic

### The Content Gap

**Bob's Observation:** Came to sunrise service, it was beautiful. Went to website — no pictures of it.

**Candi's Response:** "It's on Facebook"

**The Problem:**
- Facebook gets updated (easy, quick)
- Website stays stale (harder to update)
- Content exists but is trapped on Facebook

**Ryan's Point:** Same content can be used for local advertising — Nextdoor, Ring, etc. Create once, distribute everywhere.

### Venue Marketing (Glenn)

**Glenn:** We want people to have events here. Weddings, galas. We want this place used.

**Ryan:** To attract that, we need high-quality photos and video.

### Navigation Discussion

**Glenn:** Need to change menu structure. Navigation should be easier. Events we want to promote should be front and center.

**Bob:** Looking at NorthPoint church menu for examples.

### SEO Reality Check

**Craig:** Googled "church venue milton" — found NOTHING

**Follow-up Search:** Only thing that came up was old video from when building was under construction.

**Ryan's Response:**
- You have to have content to rank in top 10
- Sometimes you have to pay (Google Ads)

**Key Insight:** "You can't SEO your way to the top with an empty calendar" — this resonated with the room

### Messaging Discussion

**Topic:** "Who We Are" statements

**Bob's Point:** These statements would define the content we produce. Need clarity before creating content.

### Advertising Discussion

**Jennifer:** Suggests advertising to drive people to the website.

**Important Sequencing (not fully addressed):**
1. Website needs to be ready first
2. Content needs to be there
3. THEN advertising amplifies it

*Advertising a broken website = paying for disappointment*

## Post-Meeting Summary (Shareable Version)

**Ebenezer Website & Outreach Brainstorming Session**
December 4, 2025

**Attendees:** Bob Howart, Ryan, Glenn & Candi Hannigan, Lisa Coxworth, Ralf & Julie Yopf, Frida, Jennifer, Penny Evans, Craig Crouch, Charles

**Purpose:** Whiteboard session to generate and prioritize ideas for modernizing Ebenezer's outreach, with a focus on the website.

**Guiding Principles (from Bob):**
- We can't do everything — prioritize and do fewer things well
- Whatever we take on, hit a home run
- Leave room for Year 2, Year 3

**Key Themes Discussed:**

- **Vision:** Ebenezer is a welcoming, conversational community — multi-generational and multi-racial. The goal is to get people through the door so we can "love on them."

- **Website:** Needs updated photos, video, and a simplified navigation structure. Events should be front and center. Current content exists on Facebook but isn't reflected on the website.

- **Content Investment:** High-quality photos and video are foundational — they feed the website, social media, and advertising. This is a multi-month effort.

- **SEO & Visibility:** There's an opportunity to own local search terms like "venue Milton GA." Content drives search rankings; sometimes paid advertising helps too.

- **Dual Identity:** Ebenezer is both a church and an event venue (Pardue Center). The website should serve both audiences clearly.

- **Reality First:** Great marketing comes from great events. Build the portfolio, then promote it.

## Analysis & Recommendations

### What Went Well

Bob set the right tone early: prioritize, don't overcommit, hit home runs. That discipline will serve you if you stick to it. The room also got some real-time "aha" moments — Craig's Google search proving nobody owns "venue Milton" was worth more than an hour of explaining SEO theory.

There's genuine buy-in that photos and video are foundational. That's not always obvious to church committees, so the fact that everyone's nodding at that is progress.

### Areas of Concern

**1. Lots of ideas, no decisions yet.**
The whiteboard filled up, but nothing got crossed off or starred. The Dec 18 meeting needs to move from brainstorming to prioritizing — otherwise you'll leave with another list.

**2. No owner, no budget.**
Who's actually doing this work? Bob and Ryan are advisors. Charles is the current WordPress admin (and likely nervous about scope creep). Is there money for a design firm? A photographer? Paid ads? Until budget and ownership are named, these are just wishes.

**3. The dual identity got lost.**
The pre-work email nailed the core challenge — Ebenezer is a church AND a venue, and the site has to serve both. That barely came up. The Pardue Center, ticketing integration, venue-focused SEO — none of that made it to the whiteboard. That's a gap.

**4. Sequencing risk.**
Jennifer's advertising idea is valid, but the room didn't catch that advertising a broken website wastes money. The phases need to be explicit: messaging → content → website → then amplify.

**5. "Who We Are" is still fuzzy.**
Glenn gave the vision (welcoming, multi-generational, multi-racial), but that's not the same as crisp messaging. Until you can finish the sentence "Ebenezer is the church where ___" in a way that's memorable and differentiating, the content will lack focus.

### Recommendations

**Before December 18:**
- Someone drafts 2-3 candidate "Who We Are" statements for the group to react to
- Get a ballpark budget number from Ralf — what's realistic for Year 1?
- Decide: Are you hiring a design firm, or is this a DIY refresh?

**Year 1 Priorities (Recommended):**

| Priority | Why |
|----------|-----|
| 1. Nail the messaging | Everything else builds on this |
| 2. Professional photo/video shoot | Content is table stakes — can't skip this |
| 3. Website redesign with dual-path navigation | Church visitors and venue shoppers need different journeys |
| 4. Google Business Profile optimization | Quick win, free, helps local SEO immediately |
| 5. Workflow to move FB content to website | Stop letting good content die on social |

**Park for Year 2+:**
- Paid advertising (after website is solid)
- Deep SEO strategy
- Nextdoor/Ring presence
- Sign spinner (fun for big events, not a priority)

### Key Questions for Dec 18

- Do we present the church and Pardue Center as one thing or two paths?
- What ticketing platform integrates with the site for events?
- Are we optimizing for "Methodist church Milton" AND "event venue Milton" — and does the design firm know this?

### Watch Out

Be careful the WordPress admin doesn't become the de facto "just make it happen" person because they're the technical one in the room. If scope lands on them, make sure it comes with support — whether that's budget, volunteers, or reduced expectations elsewhere.
