## Church History

### Origins (1853)
In 1853, Joseph R. Lamb deeded one acre to establish Ebenezer M.E. Church for "promotion of Religion and the doctrines as taught by the Methodist Church." Circuit preachers initially served the sparse population, with the first regular pastor traveling from Roswell by steer.

### Early Buildings
Church records suggest three structures existed: a log building, an unpainted weather-board structure (described in detail by 1930s members), and the current edifice. An 1893 conference report noted the building had 250 seats and was valued at $600.

### 1931 Fire & Reconstruction
A fire destroyed Ebenezer in March 1931. The congregation relocated to property purchased from the Goodwin family and rebuilt immediately. Community members volunteered, and Sam Tate from nearby marble mines donated a pink marble speaker's stand.

### Mid-20th Century Decline
By 1973, membership dropped to 24 people, with 14 in nursing homes. Services became monthly lay-led events.

### Revitalization (1976 onwards)
Rev. Carolyn Morris, the first female minister (1972), oversaw major renovations including indoor plumbing installation. By 1976, membership grew to 53.

### Modern Expansion
- 1987-2008: Pastor Jack Pilger led 21 years of growth and fundraising
- 1999: Installation of two stained glass windows depicting the Life of Christ
- 2013: New fellowship hall built entirely through donations
- 2024: 23,000 sq ft Pardue Family Foundation Center added
